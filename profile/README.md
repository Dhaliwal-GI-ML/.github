# Dhaliwal-Prasath GI Labs

## Overview

Our lab specializes in machine and deep learning approaches to creating powerful clinical tools in gastroenterology. We provide tools for analyzing eosiniphilic data in histology reports, various NLP techniques on endoscopy and histology reports, and predictive models that predict patient response to various disease treatments.

### Endoscopy and Histology Named Entity Recognition and Entity Relation Extraction

#### Summary

Provides tools for training and running BERT based NER models on free-text endoscopy and histology reports, extracting the relationships between recognized entities, and converting extracted entities and relations into a format suited for downstream machine learning training. The user will be able to use pretrained models or use a custom annotated corpus to train their own model for these processes. This project is a subproject of the ARC Project which aims to predict patient response to Anti-TNF therapy.
